Like football boots!</p>\n<p>Having missed this week’s open goal with a clumsy panache not witnessed since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKsGT9-XB0\">Diana Ross at USA 94</a>, Robbie’s next move should be a dead cert. There are reports that, fresh from upsetting Jimmy Page over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/29/guitarist-wins-delay-in-permission-for-robbie-williams-to-build-pool\">planning permission for an underground swimming pool</a>, Robbie is set to join The X Factor’s judging panel. It’s the perfect match: the days of either the singer nor the show being able to walk a single to No 1 seem long gone; each has enjoyed on-off relationships with Gary Barlow; both make little sense to teenagers; and neither made it in America. Both are entertainment behemoths in freefall – household names too big to fail, but having a decent stab at it anyway. There’s a chance we may be on the verge of witnessing a pop cultural tandem skydive, but could these two negatives perhaps, as in the spooky world of mathematics, become a positive?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/jun/14/robbie-williams-from-world-cup-opener-to-x-factor-saviour\">Continue reading...</a>\n",
