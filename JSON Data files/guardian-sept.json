There was a newsagent dad (this was met with applause – we all liked the Beano), a pub landlord dad (more applause, some cheers from the teachers) and the dad who drove an ice-cream van (whooping, major jealousy). Then I stood up. “My daddy makes drugs,” I said.<br></p>\n<p>Obviously, in 2018, such a revelation would trigger immediate calls to social services and a hovering police chopper searching for our Breaking Bad-style meth lab.
